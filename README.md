## The Queue

The project requires you to have [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html) and cargo installed.

In the base of the project run:
``` sh 
  cargo run
```
This will compile and start the rust server.

Then build the frontend:
```sh
  cd client
  npm install
  npm run build
```
